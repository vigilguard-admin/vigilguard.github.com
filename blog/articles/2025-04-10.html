  <strong><center>Be Careful on Public Wi-Fi</center></strong>
  <br>

  <p>Public Wi-Fi in cafés, airports, or hotels may seem convenient, but it's often unsecured and risky. Hackers can intercept your data easily.</p>

  <p>
  - Avoid accessing banking or sensitive accounts<br>
  - Don’t enter passwords or personal info<br>
  - Use a VPN for a secure connection<br>
  - Turn off file sharing and auto-connect features
  </p>

  <p>Always assume public networks are being watched. If it’s not urgent, wait until you're on a trusted, secure network.</p>
