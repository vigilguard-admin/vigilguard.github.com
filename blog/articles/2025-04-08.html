  <strong><center>Enable Two-Factor Authentication</center></strong>
  <br>

  <p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your accounts. It requires a second form of verification beyond just a password.</p>

  <p>
  - Use 2FA on all accounts that offer it<br>
  - Choose methods like SMS, authenticator apps, or security keys<br>
  - Ensure your backup methods are secure<br>
  - Regularly review and update your 2FA settings
  </p>

  <p>By enabling 2FA, you significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access, even if your password is compromised.</p>
