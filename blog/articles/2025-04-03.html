  <strong><center>Do Not Share Passwords</center></strong>
  <br>

  <p>Sharing passwords may seem harmless, but it puts your accounts and data at serious risk. Even with people you trust, sharing credentials breaks accountability and security.</p>

  <p>
  - Never send passwords via email or chat<br>
  - Donâ€™t write them down on paper<br>
  - Use individual logins for team access<br>
  - Use a password manager with shared vaults if needed
  </p>

  <p>Keep your passwords private and enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for added protection.</p>
